An online database for musicians fees, to calculate averages and to see an overview with all the gigs you've done and their corresponding fees, categorized by type of gig, size of the gig, years of experience etc. 

I've used swiftUI as the UI framework. I've used CoreData for persistence purposes, Firebase as a third party framework for the online database. 

I've used MVVM as the architecture with the @Published and @ObservedObject wrappers. I've created a seperate dependency injector class to inject dependencies. 

There are some basic unit tests as well. 

This app is just for showcasing.
